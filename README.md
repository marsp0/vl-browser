# VL Browser
Browser with minimal set of dependencies and no bloat.

Work tracker - [Current Sprint](https://trello.com/b/a7SdZYpL/current) / [Completed Sprints](https://trello.com/b/njBlWiV7/sprints)

Overall goals for this project:
- [ ] [HTML5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
- [ ] [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2024/)
- [ ] [ECMA2024](https://262.ecma-international.org/) compliant javascript engine
- [ ] Minimal bloat - Different people understand different things by "bloat". I don't have it clearly defined yet, but I can give you an example of what I do not want. Installing firefox on minimal debian 12 install with Xorg requires approx. 230MB. Not sure where it is all coming from but it is too much.
